# Credit Score ANN Practice

This repository contains a practice notebook on classifying credit scores as Good, Standard, or Bad using Artificial Neural Networks.

Dataset: Credit score dataset (included)

Objective: Experiment with ANN on tabular data, explore embedding layers for categorical features, and tune hyperparameters using Bayesian Optimization.

## Key Learnings:

- Categorical embeddings for many categorical features

- Feature importance using XGBoost

- Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate) improved accuracy

- ANN outperformed XGBoost in this experiment

- Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost

- Learnt how we can reduce the learninig rate when validation loss gets plateau.
